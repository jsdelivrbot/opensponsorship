## Framworks used:
    - Bootstrap (3.3.7)
    - Angularjs (1.2.16)
    - jQuery (3.3.1)
    - npm (5.7.1)
    - nodejs (9.2.0)
    - Mongoose (5.0.9)
    - body-parser (^1.5.2")
    - express ("^4.16.2)
    - mongodb (^2.1.16)
    - morgan (^1.2.2)
    - tagmanager(3.0.2)
    - Twitter Typeahead
    - animate.css
    - fontawesome

## Tasks accomplished:
    - Application displays index.html
    - Front end sends/recieves data from API calls
    - Back end updates DB on remote server
    - App runs on Heroku (locally/remotely)
    - App does not reload or redirect (single page app)
 
## Tasks outstanding:
    - Animations are wonky and not displaying elements correctly
    - No data verification
    
    
## Notes:
    HTML was a gigantic pain to play around with. For the sake of time, I skipped a lot of
    development on the front end and focused strictly on getting the backend to work.
    
    I didn't implement data validation for the sake of saving time, although I am aware there is 
    an angular extension that should've taken care of it for me.
    
    If nothing else, this is a confirmation that, though I can perform front end development, I am
    better suited for the back.
