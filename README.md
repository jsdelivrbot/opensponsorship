## Framworks used:
    - Bootstrap (3.3.7)
    - Angularjs (1.2.16)
    - jQuery (3.3.1)
    - npm (5.7.1)
    - nodejs (9.2.0)
    - Mongoose (5.0.9)
    - body-parser (^1.5.2")
    - express ("^4.16.2)
    - mongodb (^2.1.16)
    - morgan (^1.2.2)

## Tasks accomplished:
    - Application displays index.html
    - Front end sends/recieves data from API calls
    - Back end updates DB on remote server
    - App runs on Heroku (locally/remotely)
    - App does not reload or redirect (single page app)
    
 
## Tasks outstanding:
    - Front end Boostrap input form elements don't match input data structure
    - Animations are wonky and not displaying elements correctly
    
    
## Notes:
    HTML was a gigantic pain to play around with. For the sake of time, I skipped a lot development on the front end and focused strictly on getting the backend to work
